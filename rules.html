        <div class="info-content">
            <p>Ludo is a classic strategy board game played between 2 to 4 players. While the game relies on the luck of the dice, understanding the rules and employing the right strategy is key to becoming the <strong>Ludo MINIMA</strong> champion.</p>

            <h2>1. The Objective</h2>
            <p>The main goal of the game is simple: be the first player to race all four of your tokens from your home base to the center of the board (the Home triangle). The path is clockwise around the board.</p>

            <h2>2. Starting the Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At the start, all 4 tokens for each player are placed in their respective "Yard" or Base.</li>
                <li>To enter a token into active play, you must roll a <strong>SIX (6)</strong> on the dice.</li>
                <li>If you do not roll a 6, the turn passes to the next player.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Movement & The "Six" Rule</h2>
            <p>Once a token is in play, you move it forward by the number of squares indicated by the dice roll.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bonus Turn:</strong> Rolling a 6 gives you an extra roll. You can use the 6 to move a piece or bring a new piece out, and then roll again.</li>
                <li><strong>Consecutive Sixes:</strong> If you roll 6 three times in a row, your turn is forfeited immediately to prevent unfair advantages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Capturing Opponents (Cutting)</h2>
            <p>This is where the strategy begins. If your token lands on a square currently occupied by an opponent's token:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The opponent's token is <strong>captured</strong> and sent back to their Base.</li>
                <li>The opponent must roll a 6 again to restart that token.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot capture a token if it is on a "Safe Zone" (marked with a Star or Globe).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Safe Zones</h2>
            <p>There are specific squares on the board marked with a Star icon. These are Safe Zones. No player can be captured while their token rests on these squares. It is a strategic advantage to keep your tokens here while waiting for a good roll.</p>

            <h2>6. Reaching Home (Winning)</h2>
            <p>When a token completes the full track, it enters the colored "Home Column."</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You must roll the <strong>exact number</strong> needed to reach the center Home triangle.</li>
                <li>For example, if you are 3 squares away, you must roll a 3 (or a 1 and then a 2).</li>
                <li>The first player to get all 4 tokens into the Home triangle wins the game!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pro Tips for Strategy</h2>
            <p>To maximize your winning chances on Ludo MINIMA:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open All Tokens:</strong> Don't just rely on one token. Try to get all 4 out of the base as soon as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Camp on Stars:</strong> Use safe zones to hide from opponents chasing you.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate Risk:</strong> Before making a move, check if you are landing 1-6 steps ahead of an opponent who might cut you on their next turn.</li>
            </ul>
